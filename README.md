# CaaS ( Crypto as a Service )

## Project Overview

I took an innovative approach to encrypting users' sensitive data. Instead of using a single type of salt and encryption algorithm in traditional methods, we use unique salt and encryption algorithms based on UUID for each user. In this way, each data in the database is encrypted by separate salt values and separate encryption algorithms.
Encryption is carried out in a separate microservice and the principles of "Separation of Concerns" (SoC) and "Single Source of Truth" (SSOT) are adopted. In this way, the main server can focus more on business logic and provides convenience for developers. The hashing mechanism, which is performed repeatedly, runs on the machine where the main server is located, but on a separate port as a different server, with high level security.

Using a single salt value and a single encryption algorithm for servers reduces randomness. It is possible to detect this algorithm and its salt values through reverse engineering studies (e.g. Cache miss attack). This creates a disadvantage in case the database falls into the hands of attackers. This is another aspect where this project offers a solution. Even if the database is compromised by attackers, randomness is at its highest since each row is encrypted by a separate salt and encryption algorithm.
This project aims to provide a more secure and effortless approach to encrypting user data compared to traditional methods. Encryption operations are carried out on a separate server, independent of the main server, and unique encryption configurations are created for each user.

## Features
- **Independent Encryption Server**: Encryption operations are performed on a server independent of the main server.
- **Unique Encryption**: Different salt and encryption algorithms are used for each user.
- **UUID-Based Configuration**: Unique encryption configurations are created using UUIDs.

## Technical Details
- **Cipher Pool**: A pool containing various encryption algorithms, such as blake2b, sha256, md5, etc.
- **Salt Pool**: A pool containing salt values of different lengths (8, 16, 32, 64 characters, etc.).
- **Service**: The folder where the API service logic is implemented.
- **Routes**: Endpoints for encryption operations.

## Encryption Process
1. **Data Flow**: User data is sent to the main server, which then forwards it to the encryption server.
2. **UUID Usage**: A unique salt and encryption algorithm are selected based on the user's UUID.
3. **Encryption**: The data is encrypted using the selected configuration.
4. **Returning Encrypted Data**: The encrypted data is sent back to the main server and securely stored.

## Security and Performance
- **Security**: Communication between the main server and the encryption server is secured using secure protocols. The independent encryption server adds an extra layer of security against attacks.
- **Performance**: The performance of the encryption server can affect the overall speed and efficiency of the system. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the encryption server has sufficient performance and scalability.




ðŸ“¡ API Endpoints

### ðŸ“Œ `/encrypt`

**Method:** `POST`

**Description:**
This endpoint handles encryption requests by processing sensitive data, user UUID, and an API key. It uses the provided UUID to determine the encryption and salt methods from predefined pools and returns the encrypted data as a response.

**Request Body:**
- `apiKey`: The API key for authentication.
- `userUUID`: The unique identifier for the user.
- `sensitiveData`: The data that needs to be encrypted.

**Response:**
- On success: Returns the encrypted data.
- On failure: Returns an error message if the request is not a POST request or if there is an issue with the encryption process.

**Example Request:**
```json
{
    "apiKey": "example_api_key",
    "userUUID": "4dbcbcfe-4800-40a8-badf-c26b73af230c",
    "sensitiveData": "example sensitive data"
}
```

**Example Respond:**
```json

{
    "encrypted_data": "35db2f10e244a19686cf929071a80ac7029ad03cff2b7aebff4bac148c7dd32f64cf96c0b4122eb61f4ced1bba6672c1"
}
